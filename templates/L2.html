        You head downstairs and see your
        parents in the living room. They are
        eating their meal packets and
        staring at the brick wall. That never
        seemed odd before, but now you
        wonder why they donâ€™t talk as they
        eat or even look at each other.
        "Mom, Dad, how did the world
        end", you ask, hoping your parents
        have all the answers. "End? Don't
        be silly. It can't have ended if we
        are still here!", your dad answers
        with a laugh. "Are you alright,
        sweetheart? You aren't making any
        sense". Your mother stares at you,
        concerned. They obviously don't
        have any answers.
